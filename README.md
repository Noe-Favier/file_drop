# FileDrop 
## What is it ?
File Drop is a light cloud server that comes with a web interface which allows u to download files from a repertory on the server
FileDrop is writtent in rust, without any dependency 
it can also be setup in under 3min

## How to run File Drop ?
### I have rust running on my machine 
u can follow the rust doc to compile the project : [compile a rust app](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-02-hello-world.html#:~:text=Compiling%20and%20Running%20Are%20Separate%20Steps)

### I don't have rust on my machine 
then u can wait for a github release i'll push soon

## This is really awful ðŸ¤®!
yeah, ik...
the main goal of fileDrop is to provide a light solution for people who wants to exchange files between a vps and their local machine. (for me as an example) 

## What's comming up next ? 


 1. thread clients 
 2. configuration file 
 3. Logs optimised for systemd (with `log!()`)
 4. Uploading (not only downloading) 
 5. Authentification system
 6. UI enhancement
